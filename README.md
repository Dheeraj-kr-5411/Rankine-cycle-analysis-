# Rankine-cycle-analysis with python 
python project analyzing rankine cycle efficiency and specific steam consumption from thermal data data sheet(values are selected randomly) using Numpy and Matplotlib python libraray.
Computes :
turbine work
pump work
heat added in evaporator
heat rejected in condenser
efficiency of rankine cycle and specific steam consumption
and then plot graph 1).efficiency vs boiler pressure 2).SSC vs boiler pressure
Tool used:python,numpy,matplotlib
output: as we inc pressure efficiency inc and SSC dec.
